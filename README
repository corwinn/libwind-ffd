                       File Format Description Library
                      .................................


Transforms binary data into a tree (and vice versa):
  - tree = File2Tree ("description", data)
  - data = Tree2File (tree)


Some of the details are at  "formal_description"; all of them are at the code.


This library is different: it does not do its own string and stream - you do.
Details at "ffd_model.h".
